# Progress Page

Our team was given four weeks to complete this sprint, which were themselves divided into three milestones. The first two milestones were given
one week each, while the last milestone was two weeks. To check out our progress for each milestone, view the subpages!

## Design Iteration
Our team was particularly interested in developing our skills for designing software architecture. Over the course of this project, we developed
several system diagrams that show off how our plan for the project changed over time. When reading through our milestones, be sure to pay special
attention to how these diagrams are evolving!
