### Milestone 1


#### What We've Done:

11/18:

- Got launch file that brings up four Neatos and has them follow a routine
- Made node network architecture diagram
- Researched literature on pathplanning and visual odom
- Found library for Kalman filter and started setting up sensor fusion node
- Found script for visual odometry and started cutting it down to essentials

11/20:

- Started working on camera calibration, but the node is not calibrating properly
- Continued working on visual odometry (vivian fill in)
- Continued working on launch file, created a second draft to test
